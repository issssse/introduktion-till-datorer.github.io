    # When the mounts configuration was introduced in Hugo 0.56.0, we were careful
    # to preserve the existing contentDir, staticDir, and similar configuration to
    # make sure all existing sites just continued to work. But you should not have
    # both: if you add a mounts section you should remove the old contentDir, 
    # staticDir, etc. settings.
